### What I learned

With this project I learned a lot and reforce form validation trough HTML, CSS and JS. I didn't know a RegExp, so this project was a good way to know that for validate numbers of credit card. I must continue practice and learn about regular expresions because is a very important thing to learn. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development

I'm going to continue focusin in regular expressions to give me a better understanding of this tools because this is not totally clear to me.
